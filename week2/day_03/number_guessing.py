# # Task 04: Number Guessing Game
#
# ## Objective
#
# Create a simple number guessing game where the program generates a random number, and the user has to guess it.
#
# ## Requirements
#
# 1.Generate a random number between a specified range.
# 2.Ask the user to guess the number.
# 3.Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
# 4.Allow the user to continue guessing until they guess the correct number.
# 5.Display the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
# ## Additional Challenges
#
# 1.Implement error handling to ensure the user inputs a valid number.
# 2.Allow the user to choose the range of numbers for the guessing game.
# 3.Enhance the program to provide hints or clues based on the user's previous guesses.
